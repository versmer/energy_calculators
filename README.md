# energy_calculators - reseach proposal 

This projects implies translating existant energy calculators on EnergyTools website in .xlsx format into the backend calculations used in the web environment. Ultimately, building operators should be able to upload .cvs file onto the website and get the result page with calculations and nessesary visualization. The process will minimize the likelihood of human input error, as well as improve standardization of calculation tools.
